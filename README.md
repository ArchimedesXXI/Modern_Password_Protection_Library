# Modern_Password_Protection_Library
This is a C# library for processing logins and passwords. It was created for learning purposes. It utilizes char arrays as password input, salting and "peppering" (individual and global salts), multiple iterations of hashing with SHA256 algorithm and clearing all elements of the original char array, which contained the password.
